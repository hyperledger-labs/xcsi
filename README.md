Stands for Cross chain settlement instruction

The aim of the lab is to create a cross chain settlement instruction. Many chains for issuing and trading digital assets and holding digital cash are being built. We envision a future in which chains are built on multiple platforms. To create a digital market, a chain that holds and trades assets needs to be connected to a chain accessible payment leg. Trading of assets could happen on one chain and payment could happen at a different venue. Cross chain settlement instructions are needed from the asset trading chain to the payment settlement chain. 

We are transport agnostic. All message encryption as well as at rest (if needed) is outside the scope of this lab.
